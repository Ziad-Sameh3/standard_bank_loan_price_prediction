# Loan Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project was developed as part of a **Data Science Job Simulation** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/) for **Standard Bank**. The focus was on predicting the creditworthiness of applicants for home loans. Standard Bank, Africa's largest lender by assets, aims to modernize its loan approval process using machine learning. By implementing predictive models, the bank seeks to assess applicants' loan default risks and provide instant decisions.

This project explores two approaches:
1. **AutoML**: Using automated tools like [auto-sklearn](https://www.automl.org/automl/auto-sklearn/) for model training.
2. **Traditional ML**: Implementing and tuning models manually using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).

## Project Objectives

- **Automate EDA and Model Training**: Utilize libraries like `Sweetviz` and `auto-sklearn`.
- **Build Bespoke Models**: Develop custom models with logistic regression, decision trees, and more.
- **Analyze Data**: Identify trends, missing values, and correlations in the data.
- **Evaluate Models**: Compare performance metrics between AutoML and bespoke ML approaches.

## Features

- Analyze loan data, including:
  - Distribution of loan statuses.
  - Correlation between applicant income and loan amount.
  - Credit history's impact on default rates.
- Automated exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Model training with logistic regression and other classifiers.
- Integration of AutoML for rapid prototyping.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be accessed from [Kaggle's Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset). It includes:
- **Train dataset**: Historical data for training models.
- **Test dataset**: Unseen data for predictions.
